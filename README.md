# C Improved Malloc (CIM)
## Overview

The main usecase of this library is to replace the classic 'malloc' and 'free' and other memory management functions found in the c standard library.  
This library will allow you to work on complex programs without having any possiblity of memory leaks as memory allocation and freeing will be handled by the library instead.
